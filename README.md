# MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment

This assignment focuses on learning MongoDB fundamentals including setup, CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing.

## Assignment Overview

You will:
1. Set up a MongoDB database
2. Perform basic CRUD operations
3. Write advanced queries with filtering, projection, and sorting
4. Create aggregation pipelines for data analysis
5. Implement indexing for performance optimization

## Getting Started

1. Accept the GitHub Classroom assignment invitation
2. Clone your personal repository that was created by GitHub Classroom
3. Install MongoDB locally or set up a MongoDB Atlas account
4. Run the provided `insert_books.js` script to populate your database
5. Complete the tasks in the assignment document

## Files Included

- `Week1-Assignment.md`: Detailed assignment instructions
- `insert_books.js`: Script to populate your MongoDB database with sample book data

## Requirements

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB (local installation or Atlas account)
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or MongoDB Compass

## Submission

Your work will be automatically submitted when you push to your GitHub Classroom repository. Make sure to:

1. Complete all tasks in the assignment
2. Add your `queries.js` file with all required MongoDB queries
3. Include a screenshot of your MongoDB database
4. Update the README.md with your specific setup instructions

## Resources

- [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB Node.js Driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)

## How to Run `queries.js`

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   If you haven't already, install the MongoDB Node.js driver:
   ```sh
   npm install mongodb
   ```

2. **Configure MongoDB Connection**  
   Make sure your MongoDB server is running locally or update the connection string in `queries.js` if using MongoDB Atlas.

3. **Run the Script**  
   Execute your queries using Node.js:
   ```sh
   node queries.js
   ```

   This will run all the queries defined in your `queries.js` file and output the results to the terminal.
